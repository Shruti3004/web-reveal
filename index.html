                        <h3>HTTP vs HTTPS</h3>
                        <p>
                            HTTP is a protocol to transfer data or a channel of transportation between two machines, but it sends whole data as plain text i.e. it’s human-readable,
                            so it has the threat of leaking!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here data is sent in encrypted form like, e.g.If Start is our message it can be sent as 5t@rT, it’s just an example they have a more complex
                            cryptographic algorithm for it. But the question is how it is achieved? This can be achieved by SSL/ TLS ( Secured socket Layer ) / ( Transport Layer
                            Secured ), SSL certificates are proof that data communication is through an encrypted form

                        <h3>What is DNS?</h3>
                        <p>The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet.</p>

                        <h3>What is TCP?</h3>
                        <p>
                            TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol, a communications standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages
                            over a network. It is designed to send packets across the internet and ensure the successful delivery of data and messages over networks.

                        <h3>What is an IP?</h3>
                        <p>
                            An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. IP stands for "Internet Protocol," which is the set of
                            rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network. An IP address is a string of numbers separated by periods. IP addresses are
                            expressed as a set of four numbers — an example address might be 192.158.1.38. Each number in the set can range from 0 to 255. So, the full IP
                            addressing range goes from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255.

                        <h3>What is Domain?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Think of a domain as your home address. If a friend of yours wants to visit you, how would you help him? By providing your address right? The same goes
                            for your website. The domain allows users to identify your site. Without a domain, the user would have to enter the IP address to visit your site. So
                            the domain name is actually a shortcut to your site. It is easy for users to remember the name rather than remembering some random numbers. Top-level
                            domains are- .com and .org
                        </p>
